*2016-12-16*

One of the laboratories that provided a bioactivity data set reported that they
believe that their data was unreliable; consequently we have removed this data
from the data provided by the package, and rebuilt the vignettes without using
that particular data set.


# PepSAVIms 0.9.0 #

*2016-12-03*

Initial release of the PepSAVIms R package.  This is an implementation of the
data processing and data analysis portion of the pipeline proposed in
Kirkpatrick et al.: The PepSAVI-MS Pipeline for Natural Product Bioactive
Peptide Discovery.
